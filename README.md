# shuffle-game
An iOS app game that randomly shuffles a set of "gems" and returns a total score based on the value of each gem type.

This iOS application was completed as an assignment for COSC 4355 - Ubiquitous Computing at the University of Houston. This project serves as a personal introduction to iOS application development concepts such as the UIKit, ViewControllers, StoryBoards, Protocols, Delegates, and more.
